    <hr>
    <p>From its humble beginnings in 1996, Bethel Church has grown to bless thousands of people in Elmhurst community and around the nation.  Started with handfuls of people in home Bible study more than 20 years ago, our Pastor continues to grow and expand the church.  This steady growth has blessed us to expand our outreach and in 2004 Bethel church become Bethel International church and we are now in the process of constructing a new facility.</p>
    <p>The movement is sweeping across the city of Elmhurst and is taking our worship experience to new heights.  The neighborhood also experiences transformation. Come and visit the neighborhood to experience yourself.  From developer’s multi million dollar projects all over Queens Boulevard, any one can see obvious indicators of growing population and thriving economy.  We are aware of the need of a bigger facility since several years ago.  Countless effort of fund raising has been done to accommodate growing number of members.  And 5 years ago the church purchased a multi million dollars warehouse building to be renovated as a worship facility and outreach center just off Queens Boulevard.</p>
    <p>The cost of renovation is $8 millions and within the next 2 years we will collaborate with Construction Management company to see this plan becomes a reality. When the new facility is built the church would continue to provide more and better services to the community and many new people will come and be blessed.</p>

    <p>God has used unlikely methods and resources to bless us.  Our blessings have promoted our desire to serve Him even more and allowed us to minister to others through our testimonies and the various ministries offered through the Church.  Come and join the movement by your giving as we collaborate in this building project to house even more people to be transformed and provide better programs to build the body of Christ.  Our Pastor’s vision for this new building project not only to bless this generation but also many generations to come.   Let’s follow the footsteps of our Pastor, she lives a life to leave a LEGACY.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your prayers and support.</p>
    <p>God Bless You abundantly.</p>

<h3 id="message" style="text-align: center;">PLANTING SEEDS AND WAITING FOR THE HARVEST LIKE A FARMER'S FAITH</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</p> 
    <p>The journey of following God does not mean that it is always smooth without challenges. Right now we may be struggling with problems that come one after another, or suffer persecution for doing the truth. Facing it, sometimes we get upset, tired and start to get discouraged. We begin to be tempted to think if this is all worth fighting for? What if it turns out that what happened is not what we expected? Why does it seem as if God allows and does nothing? Various questions can arise in our minds. In this week's material, we want to learn how to hold fast to God's promises even when the facts we see or feel are far from what we consider 'God's goodness' and 'His beautiful plan.'</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">FAITH</p> 
<p><em>Faith is the basis of everything we hope for and the evidence of everything we do not see   (Hebrews 11:1).</em></p>
    So, faith arises from hearing, and hearing by the words of Christ  (Romans 10:17).
    Simply put, if we combine the above two verses, we can conclude that the basis of everything we expect, and the evidence of everything we do not see, is the word of Christ that we 'hear' through spiritual ears. That is, our faith arises from the revelation of the word of Christ as animated by the Holy Spirit. This is what causes us to hold fast to God's promises even if they are not supported by visible circumstances. Why can we be so sure? Because the promise is God's own idea/initiative, He is also the one who guarantees that His words will be fulfilled. So God acted for Himself by defending His word. The next verse gives a clear example through Abraham's experience:
    
    For when God gave His promise to Abraham, He swore by Himself, for there is no one higher than Him, saying: "Surely I will bless you abundantly and will make you abundant." Abraham waited patiently and thus obtained what he was promised.
    
    Therefore, in order to further convince those who are entitled to receive the promise of the certainty of His verdict, God has bound Himself with an oath, so that by two unchanging facts, of which God cannot lie, we who seek refuge have a strong impetus to reach the hopethat lies before us     (Hebrews 6:13-15, 17-18).
    
    God's assurance gives rise to sure hope. That hope is a strong anchor to our souls. The anchor that functions a ship serves to ensure that the ship stays in its desired place in the waters, prevents the ship from drifting due to wind, waves, and currents, and allows the ship to dock. Life without anchors/hope is a life that is easily swayed by various storms of life.</p>
    
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">PATIENCE</p>  
    Patience means perseverance in times of hardship. Abraham's patience waited for the time for God to perfect his faith, so he reaped the promise. Faith without patience keeps us trapped to compromise, cut corners and rely on our own strength. Patience without faith makes us live just 'exist' without meaning, direction and maximum productivity. Those who live by faith and patiently wait for God's time, will surely receive a reward from Allah, namely His promises fulfilled in their lives.
    
    But without faith it is impossible for one to please Allah. For whoever turns to God must believe that God exists, and that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him   (Hebrews 11:6).</p>
    
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Application:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>What are God's unfulfilled promises in your life?</li>    
        <li>How can you maintain faith during the waiting period?</li>
    </ul>
<p>Like a farmer who plants seeds and patiently waits for the harvest, so we must always maintain faith and patiently wait for God's promises to be fulfilled. It is impossible for God to not keep His promises and words. Therefore, in the waiting period, keep working on our salvation and do not be slow in faith. The time of waiting for God's promises to be fulfilled is a time for us to grow in word, in love, in the knowledge of God, and in character. Make a decision to keep believing that God will fulfill His promises. Remember that God works according to His sovereignty, not too fast, not too late but just at the best time.</p>
